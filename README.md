- 👋 Hi, I’m @xtmal91 aka Tyler
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Sooo many different things. My big interest right now is A.I.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... to work with A.I., Webflow, Canva, about to start digging into Figma.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... An Online Business. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... If you are honestly interesting in teaming up with someone to build an online businesses reach out to me. I've got some projects in the works. It's just me but I've always felt like things can work better with 2 people. Extra set of eyes, another mind to brainstorm, and another person there to stop the other from making a mistake. Team work.
ONLY if you are deadly serious, email me at: Reech.outta-me1822@myself.com

I also recently built a résumé portfolio using WebFlow. I figure I should post it here to show with my other web dev projects I've got so far.
